        Welcome to my site! Here, you will find a small amount of content and small, single-page, retro-styled websites and webpages that I've made for fun, or a small project. For now, you'll just find the pages/sites I've made in the main navigation, but that might change soon. I'm also restricting myself to using mostly features from the 90's, but since some features have been deprecated or removed (such as HTML tables or super annoying flashing text), but my files will probably adhere to the HTML5 standard.<br />
        I'll be hosting the source code for everything <a href="https://github.com/Nexan-Stuff/trader-nexan" target=_blank>here</a>, on my Github group.
